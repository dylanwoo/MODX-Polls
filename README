EXAMPLE USAGE
--------------------

You can create categories to link your polls too. This feature is 
for sites wich have multiple polls needed on different pages. For 
a simple usage, it's not necessary.

On the page you want to view the poll, just paste the snippet call 
in your template or resource content, like this:

[[!PollsLatest]]

   tplVote - The main form template for the latest poll view
   tplVoteAnswer - The form template for the answers inside the main view
   tplResult - The main result template for the latest poll view
   tplResultAnswer - The result template for the answers inside the outer view

SELECTION:

   category - (Opt) will select the latest poll from the given category (id), could be multiple devided by a comma
   sortby - (Opt) to influence the normal order, order could be any field in list, defaults to id
   sortdir - (Opt) to influence the normal order direction, defaults to DESC
   [Note] No params; will select the latest poll from any category
          sortby and sortdir are normally not need to set

LINKING:
